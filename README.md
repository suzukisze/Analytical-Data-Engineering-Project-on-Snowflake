This project is an Analytical Data Engineering Project. Data will be ingested from various sources and populated into the Snowflake data warehouse. After undergoing data transformation, the data will be prepared for BI usage. The BI tool Metabase will then connect to the data warehouse to generate dashboards and reports.
